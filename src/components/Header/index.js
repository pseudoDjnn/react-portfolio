          Full Stack Developer (still studying and learning) with a penache for
          coding to make mobile friendly websites using back end and front end
          techniques. Learning the likes of HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Node, SQL,
          NoSQL, MongoDB, React, etc... gives me the ability to work under many
          disciplines, styles, and practices focusing on the personal user
          experience and web performance overall.
